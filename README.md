## Message Encryption
In this project, I tried a simple approach to encrypting and decrypting data using [transposition matrices][1] and a simple version of [RSA][2], which I wrote and based on Wikipedia's information and using NodeJs as my server/client connection.

## Use
In order to try this project, you need to have NodeJS installed on your PC, you can download nodejs [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager), after that you can clone this repo with
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/mkhdevtek/chat_encrypted.git
```
After that, open your terminal in the folder where this repo where cloned and run `npm install` and finally run `npm run start`.
And you can test this project on your localhost through the port 11200
