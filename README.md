## Message Encryption
In this project, I tried a simple approach to encrypting and decrypting data using [transposition matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose) and a simple version of [RSA](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA), which I wrote and based on Wikipedia's information.

### Objectives
This project is intended as a school project for my Systems Engineering career with a cybersecurity specialty. The assignment is about two methods of encryption, **transposition matrices** and **RSA**.
